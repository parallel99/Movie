# Movie Api
**Startup**
 - You will need a Visual Studio to open the project
 - If you want to start the project, you will need the .net 6 runtime
 - I used the "Movie_Api" profile for running the project. There are other profiles, but I haven't tried them.

**Info**
 - You won't need to migrate or any other thing, because the project contains the database (SQLite)
